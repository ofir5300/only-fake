## üîÑ Extensible News Sources

The application is designed to easily scale with additional news sources. Each source can be added by implementing a simple extractor interface, making it straightforward to:

- Add new news sources
- Customize article generation per source
- Maintain consistent typing and validation
- Scale without changing the core architecture

Currently supporting CNN and GeekTime, with a plug-and-play architecture ready for expansion.
